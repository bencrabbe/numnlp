    "This chapter illustrates an application of eigenvalues and eigenvectors to graph analytics with the PageRank algorithm. PageRank is an algorithm that maps a set of web pages to real numbers that can be used to **rank** them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm views the web as a graph whose nodes are web pages and whose edges are hyperlinks leading from one page to another. It views the structure of the web graph as a matrix. The algorithm outputs a vector of scores, with one score for each web page and it turns out that the output vector is actually the first eigenvector of the graph adjacency matrix. \n",

    "\n",
    "A set of web pages can be represented as a directed graph $G=\\langle V, E\\rangle$ whose vertices are the actual web pages.\n",
    "The edges relating the vertices are inferred from hyperlinks: a link sending an internet surfer from page $p_1$ to page $p_2$ is thus an edge $(p_1,p_2) \\in E$ of the directed graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "PageRank is an algorithm that takes advantage of the graph structure to rank the pages rathen than the page contents. It  builds upon the idea\n",
    "that a web page is important if many pages are pointing to it. In graph terminology we could use the in degree of the nodes to compute their importance. But PageRank goes one step further. It not only counts the incoming edges on the nodes but also weights their importance by the importance of the source node. Thus the page rank is a global computation on the network\n",

This property of the random surfer aims to avoid problems related to absorbing markov chains.\n",

    "To formalize the random surfer intuition, we create another stochastic matrix $\\mathbf{R}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}$ representing the surfer's capacity of performing random jumps.

    "## Final remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "PageRank illustrates the potential of markov chains for modelling graph data.\n",
    "In natural language processing, this kind of graph structure arises naturally in the context of social networks (facebook, twitter ...)\n",
    "This kind of setup is not uncommon when strictly modelling language. \n",
    "Many language problems can be framed as graph or network problems. \n",
    "The most typical are lexical and semantic networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For large or very large graphs, at web scale,  the kind of implementation provided here is inappropriate.\n",
    "Indeed the dense matrix has a size that grows quadratically with the number of nodes of the network and \n",
    "will inevitably cause both memory and run-time efficiency problems. \n",
    "Large social and semantic networks are small world networks and as such they are sparse networks. \n",
    "Actual implementations of large networks will rely on sparse matrices data structures with algorithms specialized for the case where most coefficients of the matrices are null.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variants of the power iteration method are used in a variety of setups without necessarily running the markov chain till convergence.\n",
    "This is the case of algorithms propagating information from node to node in a k-hop fashion. \n",
    "Label Propagation is a typical example in this family.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement an algorithm that ranks the nodes of the Star Wars graph using the in-degree of each node. How are the results different from PageRank ?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Suppose we have a graph of synonyms where nodes are word senses and edges represent the synonymy relation. \n",
    "\n",
    "   * Considering its adjacency matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ and a one hot vector $\\mathbf{x}$ selecting one particular word sense. \n",
    "     What mathematical operation will provide the synonym of the word sense selected by $\\mathbf{x}$ ? What operation gets the synonyms of the synonyms ?\n",
    "   * Does a markov chain using a stochastic adjacency matrix  of this graph  is likely to have absorbing nodes ? \n",
    "   * What does the PageRank of this graph would represent ?"
