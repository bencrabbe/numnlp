    "\n",
    "Optimization is the task of finding minima and maxima of numeric functions\n",
    "of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}^n\\mapsto \\mathbb{R}$.  This is a key task in many machine learning problems. In general the task has interest \n",
    "in the multivariate case, but it is convenient to take introductory examples from the monovariate case, that is with functions of the form\n",
    " $f:\\mathbb{R}\\mapsto \\mathbb{R}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Optimization methods are well behaved for the convex case, that is the case where the function is \"bowl shaped\" and where the function has a unique global minimum. This is the case we essentially focus on  here. \n",
    "The non convex case is important too but more tricky to work with since many local solutions may exist. This latter case is of practical importance when optimizing functions like neural networks.\n",

    "In practice it can overshoot: if the learning rate is too high the updates may be too strong and the algortithm might overshoot the minimum and eventually diverge. On the other hand if the learning rate is too low, the updates may be too mild\n",
    "and the algorithm may take (almost) forever to reach the minimum. The tuning of the $\\alpha$ parameter remains heuristic and it may be difficult to empirically achieve satisfying results.\n",
