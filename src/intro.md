# Numerical methods for Natural Language Processing

This book has been designed as a course aid to introduce elementary
numerical methods to students from a wide range of backgrounds. It
builds on the Python programming language

```{note}
It is assumed that the reader has already taken an introductory
 course to Python and is able to write beginner-level
programs in this language
```


This course is essentially aimed at data practitioners and data
 experimentalists.
 It is generally aimed at students who are not at ease
in mathematics. One of the aims of this course is to reconcile them with
mathematics by first showing them examples of how it is used
in natural language processing and text mining, and then encouraging
them to delve deeper into notions that might otherwise seem
too abstract.

The course is also aimed at students with a scientific background.
These students will find the link between scientific concepts
and some basic methods used in natural language processing.

At the end of this course, students are expected to have acquired elementary
basic notions of linear algebra and numerical analysis, and be
able to implement them in computer programs.
