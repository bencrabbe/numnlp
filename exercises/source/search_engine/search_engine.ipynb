      "Vader was not initially conceived of as wearing a helmet. The idea that he should wear a breathing apparatus was first proposed by concept artist Ralph McQuarrie during preproduction discussions for Star Wars with Lucas in 1975. According to McQuarrie, Lucas directed him to portray a malevolent figure in a cape with samurai armor, stating, \"George just said he would like to have a very tall, dark fluttering figure that had a spooky feeling like it came in on the wind.\" Because the script indicated that Vader would travel between spaceships and needed to survive in the vacuum of space, McQuarrie proposed that Vader should wear a space suit. Lucas agreed, and McQuarrie combined a full-face breathing mask with a samurai helmet, thus creating one of space-fantasy cinema's most iconic designs. McQuarrie's 1975 production painting of Vader engaged in a lightsaber duel with Deak Starkiller (a prototypical Luke Skywalker) depicts the former wearing black armor, a flowing cape and an elongated, skull-like mask and helmet.

Contrarily, in 1977, a New Journal and Guide writer criticized the lack of racial diversity in the original Star Wars film, pointing out that \"the force of evil ... is dressed in all black and has the voice of a black man.\" George Lucas felt hurt at such accusations.Psychiatrists have considered Vader to be a useful example for explaining borderline personality disorder to medical students. Anakin's origin story in The Phantom Menace has been compared to signifiers of African American racial identity, particularly his being a slave, and his dissatisfaction with his life has been compared to Siddartha's before he became Gautama Buddha.

The Emperor does not appear on-screen, leaving Tarkin and Darth Vader (portrayed by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) as the film's main villains.The Emperor first appears in The Empire Strikes Back, the 1980 sequel to the original film. He appears as a hologram to inform Vader that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) has become a threat to the Empire. Vader persuades him that the young Jedi would be a great asset if he could be turned to the dark side of the Force.In 1983's Return of the Jedi, the Emperor appears in person to oversee the last stages of the second Death Star's construction. He assures Vader that they will together turn Luke, Vader's son, to the dark side of the Force. Unbeknownst to Vader, the Emperor plans to replace him with Luke; Vader, meanwhile, intends to overthrow the Emperor and rule the galaxy with Luke at his side. When Vader brings Luke before his master, the Emperor tempts Luke to join the dark side by appealing to the young Jedi's fear for his friends, whom he has lured into a trap. This leads to a lightsaber duel in which Luke defeats and nearly kills Vader. The Emperor urges Luke to kill Vader and take his place, but Luke refuses and declares himself a Jedi. Enraged, the Emperor attacks Luke with Force lightning. Unable to bear the sight of his son in pain, Vader throws the Emperor down a chasm shortly before the Death Star is destroyed. 0.006433290769688273\n",

      "Star Wars creator George Lucas's conceptualization of Palpatine and the role he plays in the franchise changed over time. Lucas's initial notes discuss a line of corrupt emperors, not just one. In the 1974 draft of Star Wars, the \"New Galactic Empire\" was led by a relatively young human named Cos Dashit. The name Palpatine first appears in the prologue of Alan Dean Foster's 1976 novelization of the original Star Wars film, which detailed the Emperor's rise to power. From Return of the Jedi (1983) onwards, the Emperor became the ultimate personification of evil in the series, replacing his apprentice Darth Vader as the central villain. Though the films of the original Star Wars trilogy do not actually state the Emperor's name, the novelization of Return of the Jedi confirms his name as Palpatine.During the story development of The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Lucas decided that, with the original having only passingly mentioned the Emperor, he needed to \"begin to deal with him on a more concrete level\". Lucas realized, however, that the primary conflict with the Emperor would be best saved for the trilogy's third film, because \"[w]hen you get rid of the Emperor, the whole thing is over.\" This influenced the decision to depict the character in a hood, so his face would largely be obscured. Additionally, this look would recall Obi-Wan Kenobi. Lucas stated that \"In the end, the Emperor does exactly what [Obi-Wan] did; he can also transform himself.\" Although Palpatine dies at the end of Return of the Jedi, the plot point of his metamorphosis was utilized for the sequel trilogy, which Lucas had no direct involvement with.Lucas ultimately decided instead to focus on the Emperor in Return of the Jedi. In that film, the initial conception of Palpatine was superseded by his depiction as a dictatorial ruler adept in the dark side of the Force. The Emperor was inspired by the villain Ming the Merciless from the Flash Gordon comic books. The characterization of Palpatine as an ambitious and ruthless politician dismantling a democratic republic to achieve supreme power is in part inspired by the real-world examples of democratic backsliding during the rise and rule of Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte, Alberto Fujimori, Ferdinand Marcos Sr., and Adolf Hitler. Other elements of the character come from Richard Nixon. Lucas said that Nixon's presidency \"got me to thinking historically about how do democracies get turned into dictatorships. Because the democracies aren't overthrown; they're given away.\" Lucas also said, \"The whole point of the movies, the underlying element that makes the movies work, is that you, whether you go backwards or forwards, you start out in a democracy, and democracy turns into a dictatorship, and then the rebels make it back into a democracy.\"Lucas wanted to establish the Emperor as the true source of evil in Star Wars. Screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan noted, \"My sense of the relationship between Darth Vader and the Emperor is that the Emperor is much more powerful ... and that Vader is very much intimidated by him. Vader has dignity, but the Emperor in Jedi really has all the power.\" He explained that the climax of the film is a confrontation between Vader and his master. In the first scene that shows the Emperor, he arrives at the Death Star and is greeted by a host of stormtroopers, technicians, and other personnel. Lucas states he wanted it to look like the military parades on \"May Day in Russia.\"Lucas fleshed out the Emperor in the prequel trilogy. According to Lucas, Palpatine's role in The Phantom Menace is to explain \"how Anakin Skywalker [later Vader] came to be Palpatine's apprentice\" and the events that sparked Palpatine's rise to totalitarian power after being a senate representative. The film's novelization is the first time he is called Darth Sidious. His home world, Naboo, is also home to Anakin's romantic interest, Padmé Amidala, who later becomes a senator of that planet. 0.006433290769688273\n",

He is portrayed as a charismatic politician—and, secretly, a Sith lord powerful with the dark side of the Force—who orchestrates the invasion of Naboo and the Clone Wars, ends the Jedi Order and the Republic, and seduces Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker into becoming his apprentice, Vader. In The Rise of Skywalker (2019), the final film in the sequel trilogy, Palpatine is revealed to be the paternal grandfather of protagonist Rey and the mastermind behind Snoke, whom he created to lead the First Order against the New Republic and seduce Skywalker's grandson, Ben Solo, into becoming the villainous Kylo Ren.  0.006433290769688273\n",

It's not so much about not having a moral center, it's just that the only thing that mattered is increasing power.\" He admitted, \"I've been trying to find a redeeming feature to Palpatine, and the only one I've got so far is that he's clearly a patron of the arts because he goes to the opera.\" McDiarmid compared the character to Iago from William Shakespeare's Othello: 0.006433290769688273\n",

      "The first appearance of Palpatine in Star Wars literature was in the prologue of Alan Dean Foster's ghostwritten novelization of the script of A New Hope, published as Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker (1976). His background as a senator of the Republic was explored in James Kahn's novelization of Return of the Jedi.Palpatine also appears in Rae Carson's novelization of The Rise of Skywalker, which expands upon the film's story. In the book, Palpatine is revealed to have discovered the \"secret to immortality\" from his former master, Darth Plagueis, using this knowledge to survive after his death in Return of the Jedi. The novelization also describes Palpatine's son as a failed clone of himself. However, the 2021 book Skywalker: A Family at War describes Palpatine's son as an \"offshoot of [his] genetic research, not precisely a clone but made of cloned tissue and donated cells.\"Star Wars: Lords of the Sith (2015) was one of the first canon spin-off novels to be released in the Disney canon begun in 2014. In it, Vader and Palpatine find themselves hunted by revolutionaries on the Twi'lek home planet Ryloth. In Thrawn (2017), the titular character warns Palpatine of \"threats lurking in the Unknown Regions.\" Chuck Wendig's Aftermath book trilogy reveals that, prior to his death, Palpatine enacted a plan for the remnants of the Empire, intended to be led by his adoptive son Gallius Rax, to retreat to the Unknown Regions, where they formed into the First Order. The dark side was thought to be concentrated in this region, where one Sith cultist believed that Palpatine would be found alive. The upcoming illustrated book Star Wars: The Secrets of the Sith is told from Palpatine's perspective.Palpatine appears frequently in the comic book series Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith (2017–2018), written by Kieron Gillen and Charles Soule. It is suggested at the end of the series that Palpatine manipulated the Force to impregnate Vader's mother Shmi Skywalker, making him, in essence, Vader's father—although this is left somewhat ambiguous. This builds on the plot point of Anakin's virgin birth introduced in The Phantom Menace, and the claim that a Sith lord \"could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life,\" as Palpatine tells Anakin in Revenge of the Sith. This would seem to have incestuous implications for Rey and Ben Solo at the end of The Rise of Skywalker, but Soule says that \"The Dark Side is not a reliable narrator,\" and a Lucasfilm story group member who collaborated on the comic confirmed that a direct connection between Palpatine and Vader was not their intent.The character also appears in the final chapter of the comic book Star Wars: The Rise of Kylo Ren (2020), which illustrates Palpatine's manipulation of the young Ben Solo into becoming Kylo Ren. 0.006433290769688273\n",

In the DVD commentary to the Special Edition of Return of the Jedi, Lucas notes that, if the technology had been available in 1983, Jabba the Hutt would have been a CGI character similar to the one that appears in the Special Edition scene of A New Hope.Jabba the Hutt only speaks Huttese on film, but his lines are subtitled in English. His voice and Huttese-language dialogue were performed by the uncredited voice of Larry Ward. A heavy, booming quality was given to Ward's voice by pitching it an octave lower than normal and processing it through a subharmonic generator. A soundtrack of wet, slimy sound effects was recorded to accompany the movement of the puppet's limbs and mouth.Jabba the Hutt's musical theme throughout the film, composed by John Williams, is played on a tuba. The theme is very similar to one which Williams wrote for a heavyset character in Fitzwilly (1967), though the theme does not appear on that film's soundtrack album. Williams later turned the theme into a symphonic piece performed by the Boston Pops Orchestra featuring a tuba solo by Chester Schmitz. The role of the piece in film and popular culture has become a focus of study by musicologists such as Gerald Sloan, who says that Williams' piece \"blends the monstrous and the lyrical.\"According to film historian Laurent Bouzereau, Jabba the Hutt's death in Return of the Jedi was suggested by script writer Lawrence Kasdan. Lucas decided that Leia should strangle him with her slave chain. He was inspired by a scene from The Godfather (1972) where an obese character named Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) is garroted by an assassin. 0.0036402535263991486\n",

To say that someone \"looks like Jabba the Hutt\" is commonly understood as a slur to impugn that person's weight or appearance. Jabba the Hutt has also come to represent greed and anarchy, especially in the business world. Lindsey Boylan, the first accuser of New York's 56th Governor Andrew Cuomo for sexual harassment, compared Cuomo to Jabba the Hutt. Robin Mukherjee wrote about \"inner selves\" and described his \"inner self\" to Jabba the Hutt, stating: \"It is pleasure-seeking to the point of gluttonous, has a sense of lust that seems to never be satisfied, and personifies the sin of sloth.\" The Turkish Cultural Community of Austria stated that a Lego toy set of Jabba's palace was racially biased of two religious structures in Turkey, because Jabba the Hutt is a \"racial prejudice and vulgar insinuations against … Orientals and Asians as sneaky and criminal personalities.\" Carrie Fisher, actress of Princess Leia, said that if Donald Trump were to play a Star Wars character it would be Jabba the Hutt, because of the sexual allegations against him. 0.0036402535263991486\n",

Blake Hawkins of Comic Book Resources said that Jabba the Hutt is \"definitely one of the strangest, grossest things in Star Wars\". Jabba the Hutt ranked #5 on the Forbes Fictional 15 list of wealthiest fictional characters in 2008. Business Insider's Travis Clark said, \"Like Stormtroopers or Darth Vader, some villains just come to mind when you think of Star Wars. Jabba is another one of them.\" Lance Cartelli of GameSpot put Jabba at 12th for the greatest Star Wars villains. Declaring that Jabba is \"without a doubt the finest Star Wars portrait of the id\" and that you have to \"admire his dedication of being his true, absolutely horrendous self\", Jabba made it at Rolling Stone's 16th position for the 50 best Star Wars characters of all time.Jabba the Hutt's CGI appearance in the re-release of A New Hope has often been compared to his puppet in Return of the Jedi, with most commenters preferring the puppet. After the Hutt Twins' first appearance in The Book of Boba Fett, Matt Singer of ScreenCrush wrote that no Hutt species should ever be CGI as it does not \"look real\". TheWrap's Phil Owen said that the CGI Jabba looked \"incredibly horrible\".

      "Designed by visual effects artist Phil Tippett, Jabba the Hutt was inspired by the anatomy of several animal species. His body structure and reproductive processes were based on annelid worms, a hairless animal that has no skeleton and are hermaphroditic. Jabba's head was modeled after that of a snake, complete with bulbous, slit-pupilled eyes and a mouth that opens wide enough to swallow large prey. Moist, amphibian qualities were given to his skin. Jabba's design would come to represent almost all members of the Hutt species in subsequent Star Wars fiction.In Return of the Jedi, Jabba is portrayed by a one-ton puppet that took three months and half a million dollars to construct. While filming the movie, the puppet had its own makeup artist. The puppet required three puppeteers to operate, making it one of the largest ever used in a motion picture. Stuart Freeborn designed the puppet, while John Coppinger sculpted its latex, clay, and foam pieces. The puppeteers included David Alan Barclay, Toby Philpott, and Mike Edmonds, who were members of Jim Henson's Muppet group. Barclay operated the right arm and mouth and read the character's English dialogue, while Philpott controlled the left arm, head, and tongue. The tongue was a light beige color and came out of Jabba's mouth several times. When he encountered Leia Organa for the first time and enslaved her, he extended his tongue and licked at her face. Leia reacted with such disgust upon seeing the tongue because, in one take, Philpott moved the tongue closer than what Carrie Fisher was comfortable with, and it licked her unintentionally. Edmonds, the shortest of the three men, who also played the Ewok Logray in later scenes, was responsible for the movement of Jabba's tail. Tony Cox, who also played an Ewok, would assist as well. The eyes and facial expressions were operated by radio control. 0.0036402535263991486\n",

Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker (voiced by Matt Lanter) and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano (voiced by Ashley Eckstein) return him to Jabba in exchange for the safe passage of Republic ships through his territory. This is backed up by Padme exposing Ziro's crimes to Jabba, who vows to ensure that Ziro will be punished severely.Jabba subsequently appeared in a handful of episodes of The Clone Wars series, starting in the third season. In the episode \"Sphere of Influence\", wherein Jabba is faced by Chairman Papanoida, whose daughters were kidnapped by Greedo, Jabba allows a sample of Greedo's blood to be taken to prove him the kidnapper. In the episode \"Evil Plans\", Jabba hires the bounty hunter Cad Bane (voiced by Corey Burton) to bring him plans for the Senate building.

      "Boba Fett is primarily played by Jeremy Bulloch in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Bulloch's half-brother alerted him to the role. He was cast as Fett because the costume happened to fit \"as if a Savile Row tailor had come out and made it\"; he did not have to do a reading or screen test, and Bulloch never worked from a script for either film.Filming the role for Empire lasted three weeks. The actor was pleased with the costume and used it to convey the character's menace. Bulloch based his performance on Clint Eastwood's portrayal of the Man with No Name in A Fistful of Dollars; similar to the Western character, Bulloch cradled the blaster prop, made the character seem ready to shoot, slightly tilted his head, and stood a particular way. Bulloch did not try to construct a backstory for the character, and said later that \"the less you do with Boba Fett, the stronger he becomes\". Playing Fett in Empire was both the smallest and most physically uncomfortable role Bulloch has played; Bulloch said donning the heavy jetpack was the worst aspect of the role.Bulloch spent four weeks on Return of the Jedi. He was unaware of Fett's demise before filming began and was \"very upset\" by the development; he would like to have done more with Fett. Still, Bulloch believed killing Fett made the character stronger, and that his \"weak\" death makes fans want the character to return. Bulloch thought a scene created for the 1997 Special Edition in which Fett flirts with one of Jabba the Hutt's dancers was not in keeping with the character's nature.A younger version of the character was played by Daniel Logan in Attack of the Clones, which establishes that Boba is a clone of his father, Jango. Logan had not seen any of the Star Wars films before being cast as Fett, but he watched the original trilogy at Lucas' request. The actor had to rely on his imagination for the bluescreen filming.

The following draft saw Solo as a bearded, flamboyant pirate, franchise creator George Lucas settling on making him a human to better develop the relationship between the three central characters (Luke, Leia and Han) and Chewbacca instead being used for the part of the alien sidekick. By the time of the third draft, Solo had developed into the \"tough James Dean style starpilot\" that would appear in the finished film. Lucas also used Humphrey Bogart as a point of reference in his development notes. Mythologist Joseph Campbell said of Han, \"He thinks he's an egoist; but he really isn't. ... there's something else pushing [him].\" In 1997, Lucas described him as \"a cynical loner who realizes the importance of being part of a group and helping for the common good\". In 2004, Lucas explained that Han is the selfish sidekick of protagonist Luke, who is selfless.Harrison Ford was not immediately cast for the role of Han Solo, as Lucas had already used him in the 1973 film American Graffiti and wanted somebody new for the role. He hired Ford to rehearse lines with other actors and he was so impressed by the actor's performance that he eventually cast him.

Han would have to \"talk with a leader ... who controls commerce in the galaxy\", which the Empire is reliant upon and with whom \"Han has some kind of relationship ... like [a] stepfather\". Lucas thought this could utilize a backstory involving Han having been an orphan who lived on the Wookiee planet until his adoption.

Abrams felt the character was not evolving or contributing to the story's development; he believed that Kylo Ren killing his own father would give him a chance to develop into a worthy successor for Darth Vader.

In The Rising Force (set 12 years before The Phantom Menace), Yoda encourages Qui-Gon to take a new Padawan learner, following the failure of his previous apprentice Xanatos, who turned to the dark side of the Force years before. Qui-Gon observes a small lightsaber tournament among a group of the Temple's older students, which includes 12-year-old Obi-Wan.

The Kaleesh were at war with the rival Huk species and Sheelal was considered a demigod by his people for his victories in the Huk War. He fell in love with a warrior named Ronderu lij Kummar. Following Kummar's death during a mission, Sheelal realized that he was destined to forever mourn for her and rechristened himself as Grievous.

      "The official Star Wars Databank describes General Grievous as \"a brilliant Separatist military strategist and a feared Jedi hunter\". He is cruel, cunning, aggressive, murderous, and gains an infamous reputation for his ruthlessness during the Clone Wars. Grievous holds the title of Supreme Martial Commander of the Separatist Droid Armies, making him the absolute leader of the Confederacy of Independent Systems' military and the second highest-ranking member of the Separatist Alliance (after Count Dooku, the political Head of State). Although aligned with the Separatists, Grievous does not care for their political ideals and has professed that he only participates in the conflict to eliminate the Jedi. He harbors a deep-seated resentment of the Jedi and has a vast collection of lightsabers claimed from his many victims as war trophies. Grievous is also short-tempered and has little tolerance for failure or weakness, as he frequently lashes out against and destroys his own battle droids for their persisting incompetence.Grievous' cyborg body was specifically designed to rival the abilities of the Jedi. Standing at 7 ft 1 in (216 cm), his imposing presence serves to instill fear in his opponents to give him a psychological advantage in battle. While he is not Force-sensitive, Grievous has been trained in all forms of lightsaber combat by Count Dooku. Each of his mechanical arms can separate in half, allowing him to wield four lightsabers at once to overwhelm his enemies. His cybernetic enhancements give him exceptional strength, speed and reflexes to outmaneuver Force-users and even the Force itself. In spite of Grievous' physical and acrobatic prowess, Dooku has advised him to retreat should he lose the elements of surprise and intimidation, and thus his advantage, in a fight against the Force-sensitive Jedi. Grievous often heeds his mentor's advice and becomes known as one of the Jedi's most elusive adversaries during the Clone Wars.Grievous first appeared in Genndy Tartakovsky's Clone Wars before his character traits had been finalized for Revenge of the Sith. According to Tartakovsky, Lucas initially pitched Grievous to him as \"this ruthless, totally capable Jedi killer,\" but later developed the character into \"one of those old B-serial villains who does something bad ... twirls his mustache and then runs off.\" The series depicted Grievous as a nigh-unstoppable fighter capable of dispatching multiple Jedi simultaneously with ease, which contradicted the then-upcoming film's less powerful portrayal of the character. To reconcile these continuity differences, the series finale of Clone Wars sees Mace Windu crush Grievous' chestplate with the Force, damaging his internal organs and providing a reason for both his hacking cough and his weakened state in the film. However, The Clone Wars would later present Grievous with his cough throughout the entirety of its run.There remain numerous accounts of Grievous' backstory. Literature in the Star Wars Expanded Universe written by Warren Fu, the original designer of Grievous, had the general's hatred of the Jedi stem from their role in the plight and enslavement of his people. A shuttle crash orchestrated by Dooku and pinned on the Jedi mortally wounds Grievous and leads to his reconstruction as a cyborg. The Clone Wars would later suggest that Grievous was denied the right to become a Jedi due to his lack of connection to the Force. Writers Dave Filoni and Henry Gilroy postulated that Grievous volunteered for cybernetic modifications to rival the Jedi that rejected him. In the series, Grievous' castle displays statues hinting at his gradual progression as a cyborg. Despite this, Filoni elected to keep Grievous' backstory ambiguous. 0.0020918607808759213\n",

Zorii still maintains much resentment toward Poe for having left and nearly kills him upon meeting him again in Kijimi, but decides to help when Rey defeats her in combat. Zorii, reconnecting with Poe, tells him that she plans to travel the galaxy, and invites Poe to join her.

Poe leads a counterattack on the First Order to give the last Resistance fighters more time board the transports. When they do so, Leia orders Poe to pull back, but he insists that they seize the opportunity to destroy one of the First Order's Dreadnoughts, and calls in a team of bombers. While they are successful in taking out the ship, all of the bombers are destroyed and their crews killed, as Leia slaps and demotes Poe to captain for his recklessness and disobeying orders. The First Order soon attacks again, having tracked the Resistance through lightspeed, a feat previously believed to have been impossible. The attack claims the lives of nearly all of the Resistance's leadership and renders Leia unconscious. While Poe assumes that he will become the acting general, Leia is instead replaced by Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern), who dismisses his suggestions due to his earlier reckless actions. Poe concocts a plan with Finn and mechanic Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) to disable the First Order's tracker from within their lead Star Destroyer, but keeps the operation a secret from Holdo. Discovering that Holdo's plan is to have the Resistance forces abandon their vulnerable cruiser, Poe stages a mutiny. Finn, Rose, and BB-8 fail to disable the tracker, and an awakened Leia stops Poe's mutiny and resumes command though both Leia and Holdo express respect for Poe's daring. Leia later reveals to Poe that Holdo's plan was always to use the cruiser to draw the First Order off while the transports escaped undetected.

Along with Luke and Biggs Darklighter, Antilles is one of only three X-wing pilots to survive until the final attack runs along the Death Star's trench. However, his X-wing is damaged, and he is forced to disengage before the Death Star is destroyed.

He flies a snowspeeder under the callsign \"Rogue Three\" against the Empire's AT-AT ground assault with Wes Janson as his harpoon gunner. Their snowspeeder inflicts the first casualty against the AT-AT attack group by firing a harpoon trailing a tow cable into one of the walker's legs and circling the walker several times, causing it to trip and fall and allowing Rebel forces to destroy the walker.

He was cast after Star Wars sound designer Ben Burtt approached him in 1983, while Bauersfeld was producing a radio drama with Lucasfilm sound designer Randy Thom and suggested he audition for the part of Ackbar. The recording session took one hour, and Bauersfeld made up the voice on the spot after looking at a photograph of Ackbar, without having any other information about the character. According to Bauersfeld: \"I saw the face, and I knew what he must sound like.\"Bauersfeld did not receive an on-screen credit for his roles as Ackbar and Bib Fortuna, and his association with the characters was unknown for years after the film was released. In a 1999 interview, Timothy Rose said he did not know who provided the voice, and thought it was possible that it was his own voice modified with a synthesizer.

The line has become a popular Internet meme, with The Independent calling him \"perhaps the franchise's most memed character\". More than 1,000 fan videos have been created on the video-sharing website YouTube featuring or parodying Ackbar and that line of dialogue, including trap music and techno remixes built around it. The line did not appear in the original script for Return of the Jedi, and instead was first written as \"It's a trick!\", but it was changed in post-production after the filmmakers decided it was not as effective a line as they had originally hoped.Erik Bauersfeld said of the line: \"The fans who write say they'll never forget 'It's a trap!' I don't even remember how I said it.\" International Business Times writer Amy West said the line has \"become somewhat cult-like in the eyes of the Star Wars fanbase\". Ben Sherlock of Screen Rant called the line \"one of the most memorable quotes in the saga's history, for reasons that are unknown yet somehow obvious, and it immortalized what could've been a forgettable character\". Renaldo Matadeen of Comic Book Resources called the line \"a pop culture touchstone\".Footage of Ackbar reciting the line was featured on both Comedy Central comedy shows The Daily Show and The Colbert Report on February 11, 2010, alongside clips of various Republican Party politicians insisting a White House invitation by President Barack Obama was a trap. \"It's a Trap!\", the 2011 episode of the animated comedy series Family Guy spoofing Return of the Jedi, took its name from Ackbar's famous line; Ackbar himself makes an appearance in the episode, portrayed by the character Klaus Heissler – a talking goldfish – from the animated series American Dad!.

      "Several fans expressed disappointment with Ackbar's sudden death in The Last Jedi, calling it abrupt and unceremonious. Fans particularly criticized that Ackbar was only featured in the background of the shot where he dies, with the camera focused primarily on Leia Organa, and that his death is mentioned only in passing by other characters later. Scott Chitwood of TheForce.net said: \"He deserved a little more attention. I would have liked to see him killed in action in the final battle, but I guess that's asking a lot of a sickly old Admiral\". Screen Rant writer Ben Sherlock wrote of Ackbar's death: \"It was such a fleeting moment that many fans didn't even realize it had happened. They looked down for one second to get a handful of popcorn, and when they looked back up, Ackbar was gone\". Nate Jones of New York magazine's website Vulture, called the death scene \"disrespectful\" and \"unfathomably rude\", and that Ackbar \"deserved better than to go out in a throwaway moment\".Ackbar actors Tim Rose and Tom Kane also said they were disappointed with how the character's death was handled. Rose hoped Ackbar would have a more substantial role in The Last Jedi than he had in the latter film, and was unhappy the character again received little screen time and was abruptly killed. Rose said: \"Each day I would come to work going, 'Is today the day when Ackbar gets something a bit more involving?' And I looked at my script and I went, 'Oh, Ackbar's going out of the window. Well, that's that then!'\". Kane likewise thought the death scene was poorly handled, and believed Ackbar should have been given the larger role in The Last Jedi that went to Vice-Admiral Amilyn Holdo, a new character played by Laura Dern. The Last Jedi editor Bob Ducsay said he was also disappointed with how the scene was handled, saying it was \"slightly incidental\", though he said the scene was intentionally designed that way and he did not come to have second thoughts about it until after watching the completed film. Gary Whitta, who co-wrote the story for the film Rogue One and wrote several other Star Wars projects, said he was saddened by how quickly Ackbar died. Chris Terrio, who later co-wrote the story for The Rise of Skywalker and created/voiced the character's son Aftab, similarly stated that he \"went to mourning a bit\" when Ackbar was killed in The Last Jedi, given how much he had loved the character since his childhood.Others defended the way Ackbar's character was killed. Alex Leadbeater, features editor of the website Screen Rant, felt the scene was widely misunderstood by fans and served to advance the storyline, particularly to establish the ensuing conflict between Holdo and Resistance pilot Poe Dameron. Leadbeater wrote: \"Ackbar had no place in The Last Jedi's narrative. ... You can argue he should have had a greater send off (but) it must be said that to do so would undercut the entire set piece.\" In The Last Jedi episode of the comedic animated webseries How It Should Have Ended, which parodies and reimagines aspects of popular films, Ackbar's character survives the bridge attack after claiming he has to go to the bathroom at the time the bridge is shot, and he assumes control of the Resistance afterward. 0.0016503786528586704\n",

While backstage at the workshop where several alien puppets were stored, Rose saw Ackbar's sculpt on a display stand and asked Phil Tippett if he could play the part. Tippett told him it was a background character, and Rose did not know Ackbar would play a major supporting role in the film.

Rose was not required to audition for the part of Ackbar before being given the role.Rose returned to portray Ackbar in The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. Each day he was provided with pages from the script only for the specific scenes that were being shot, so he knew little about the final role Ackbar would play in the films until shooting took place. Rose was frustrated by the amount of secrecy on the set, which he felt prevented him and the other actors from having everything they needed to do their jobs as well as possible. Many of Ackbar's scenes were cut from the first film, which Rose said was a disappointment to him \"after waiting 30 years to reprise Ackbar\". After the character's scenes in The Last Jedi were complete, the crew took footage of Rose in the Ackbar's costume saying \"It's a wrap\", a reference to the character's death and his famous \"It's a trap\" line.

      "Admiral Ackbar appeared in the first two films of the Star Wars sequel trilogy, which were distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures after The Walt Disney Company acquired Lucasfilm in 2012. His character is retired from military service before the events of the films, but Leia Organa convinces him to come out of retirement to fight against the First Order, a military dictatorship that was formed from the remnants of the original Empire. He regains his prior rank of Admiral and serves as one of the leaders of the Resistance, a paramilitary organization led by Leia, who is now a General. Ackbar is in command of the Resistance fleet, with the Mon Calamari cruiser Raddus as his flagship. Ackbar is widely respected by the Resistance personnel as one of the few living commanders to have faced the Empire during the height of its power. In the first film, Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015), Ackbar appears at the headquarters of the Resistance, and helps develop the plan to destroy the First Order's new superweapon, Starkiller Base. He later monitors the successful attack against the weapon alongside Leia from the Resistance base on the planet D'Qar.Members of the cast and crew were particularly excited to film a scene with Ackbar. Ben Rosenblatt, a co-producer with The Force Awakens, said having Ackbar on the set was \"the moment that meant the most to me, personally\", adding: \"Security has been so tight, we're not allowed to take pictures or anything, but I had to take a picture of Ackbar on set and show it to my brothers because we loved Ackbar.\" Actor John Boyega, who portrayed Finn, said of performing with Ackbar: \"as a Star Wars fan, it doesn't get any cooler than that.\" Gary Whitta, a writer who has worked on several Star Wars projects, said: \"When I went to the set of The Force Awakens, the first thing I had to do was put on the Admiral Ackbar mask, and I did. It was a big deal, and I've always loved that character.\"In the trilogy's second film, Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017), Ackbar leads the Resistance as they evacuate their base on D'Qar, and orders the ships to jump to hyperspace to escape the First Order. The First Order fleet pursues the Resistance, sending Kylo Ren and other TIE fighters after the MC85 Star Cruiser Raddus, on which Ackbar and other senior Resistance leaders are aboard. The First Order ships open fire on the main bridge of the Raddus, causing a massive explosion and blowing all occupants into the vacuum of space. Ackbar is killed, along with everyone else on the bridge except for Leia, who is saved by her use of the Force. Although Ackbar had no lines of dialogue during his death scene in the film, the comic book adaptation of The Last Jedi revealed that his last words were: \"Torpedoes inbound. It's been an honor serving with you all.\" Whitta, who wrote the comic book adaptation, said he was saddened Ackbar died so quickly in the film, so he wanted to give him \"a little bit of a moment before he dies\".Ackbar's total screen time across all three of his Star Wars film appearances totaled only three minutes and 30 seconds. He was originally planned to appear in Rogue One (2016), a standalone anthology film separate from the sequel trilogy. During the initial screenwriting process, he appeared leading a space fleet during the climactic space battle at the end of the film. However, he was removed in later script revisions and his part replaced by Admiral Raddus, who, in an homage to Ackbar, was also a member of the Mon Calamari species. Whitta, who co-wrote the story of the film, said he wanted Ackbar included, but since he was already featured in The Force Awakens, the team behind Rogue One decided the character should not appear in two films released so closely together. 0.0016503786528586704\n",

      "Ackbar has 14 lines of dialogue in Return of the Jedi, and the character's scenes took six weeks to shoot. Due to uncertainty whether the mouth about movement Ackbar puppet would look realistic while delivering dialogue, alternative scenes were shot with General Crix Madine, a human character portrayed by Dermot Crowley, delivering Ackbar's most important lines, in case they had to be used instead. None of these shots ultimately had to be used in the final film. Occasionally, members of the film crew jokingly referred to the Ackbar character as \"Ernie Ackbar\", and his name appeared that way on some of the film's progress reports. When the inside of the costume became hot, visual effects artist Phil Tippett, who designed most of the film's creatures, would use a hair dryer to blow cool air through the mouth of the Ackbar mask to keep Rose comfortable.Although the character was created with the best available puppetry technology at the time, Lucas was not entirely pleased with the final result and felt it was a compromise. According to the book Star Wars Costumes: The Original Trilogy, published in 2014, the original masks used for the Ackbar costumes are \"in a fragile state today.\" During filming of the 2005 Star Wars film Revenge of the Sith, Lucas was so impressed with the animatron mask used on the Mon Calamari character Meena Tills that he briefly considered reediting Return of the Jedi and replacing footage of Admiral Ackbar with an improved mask.

      "Admiral Ackbar was best known for his appearance in the film Return of the Jedi, the final entry in the original Star Wars trilogy. However, before the May 1983 debut of that film, the character made his first chronological appearance in the Star Wars newspaper comic strip by Archie Goodwin and Al Williamson. Published by the Los Angeles Times Syndicate, the strip ran in newspapers across the United States from November 1982 to January 1983. In the comic, Ackbar was portrayed as the leader of the Mon Calamari, an alien species of fish-like, amphibious humanoids with salmon-colored skin, webbed hands, high-domed heads, and large fish-like eyes, and who can breathe both on land and underwater. They are allies of the Rebel Alliance in their conflict with the Galactic Empire. In the comic, which is set before the events of the film The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Ackbar and his crew are stranded on the planet Daluuj after an Imperial attack, and they are rescued by Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Princess Leia Organa in the Millennium Falcon. Ackbar demonstrates his tactical abilities by agitating water monsters in a ploy to raise the sunken Falcon from a mud swamp.Ackbar's backstory was not explained in Return of the Jedi, but has been established in Star Wars books and other media since the film was released. He is from the planet Mon Cala, a world almost entirely covered by water, where his species built giant floating cities. Ackbar is the leader of his home town, Coral Depths City, when forces from the Galactic Empire invade and nearly destroy the planet. Despite the Mon Calamari's attempts to make peace, the Imperial forces destroy several of their cities, steal their technology, and enslave its population. Ackbar is one of the first to be enslaved, and becomes an interpreter and personal servant to Grand Moff Tarkin, a secondary antagonist from the first Star Wars film. During this time, Ackbar learns much about both the Empire and military tactics in general, as well as about the Rebel Alliance and the Death Star, a moon-sized superweapon Tarkin is developing at the time. Ackbar takes detailed notes about what he observed with the hopes of eventually escaping back to his people and using the information against the Empire.Ackbar is freed from captivity during a failed attempt by Rebel forces to capture Tarkin. He joins the Rebel Alliance, where the knowledge he obtained during his captivity made him indispensable. Ackbar returns to the Mon Calamari people and, after leading them through numerous conflicts, convinces them to formally support the Rebel cause, bringing with them the massive Mon Calamari cruisers that drastically improves the strength of the Rebel fleet. Starting with the rank of Commander, Ackbar helps design the B-wing, a powerful line of starfighters. This success prompts Rebel leader Mon Mothma to promote him to Admiral, news he reacts to heavily due to the weight of the responsibility. Following events in the film Star Wars, including the destruction of the Death Star, Ackbar helps the other Rebel leaders establish new bases of operation and manage a Rebel mobile task force in starships spread across the galaxy. He rises up the ranks until Mothma promotes him to commander of the entire Rebel fleet and head of military operations, as well as one of her top advisers. 0.0016503786528586704\n",

      "Costume designer Michael Kaplan had the idea to give Snoke gold robes to contrast from his red and black throne room in The Last Jedi. Director Rian Johnson said the red motif was intended to evoke curtains in a nod to The Wizard of Oz, in which the titular character hides behind a curtain. The throne room was designed to look theatrical as opposed to Palpatine's, which was more utilitarian. The conceptual designers of the set were inspired by unused concept art for Return of the Jedi depicting the Emperor's lava-based lair under the surface of Coruscant. According to The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary (2017), the gold ring Snoke wears is set with obsidian from Darth Vader's castle on Mustafar.

Furthermore, Snoke's reluctance to meet in person with his First Order underlings helped conceal the fact that he was an artificial being. General Pryde (Richard E. Grant), a supporting villain in The Rise of Skywalker, was one of the few characters who knew Snoke was subservient to a higher power.

Various fan theories about his origins were held so strongly among some viewers that it was difficult for them to accept his demise in The Last Jedi. Rian Johnson's decision to kill the character without developing him further was criticized by many, and is commonly cited as one of the divisive film's biggest failings. Serkis addressed the criticisms by saying producers wanted the character \"to have a great deal of mystery\", but that he \"has been asked to not shed anything should they want to bring him back in any way, whether prequel or whatever\". Forbes criticized The Force Awakens for not developing Snoke as a character, or exploring his backstory and inexplicable rise to power after the events of the original trilogy, calling the character \"a bandage poorly placed over a gaping plot-hole\". Serkis acknowledged that some fans found the lack of backstory \"incredibly frustrating\", but suggested this as an opportunity to layer Snoke in a future story.

He would support the Empire, thinking that he could outsmart the Imperials before coming to see the Rebellion as a more worthy cause.Lucas thought Lando could superficially look like a normal human but—drawing from the Clone Wars mentioned in the original Star Wars film—be a clone from a ruling clan of others just like him (causing Princess Leia to distrust him). His faction, from one of many planets of clone countries, was probably \"partly responsible for the war\".

Journalist Andrew Street from The Guardian called it a \"classic twist\", comparing it to Yoda's role in The Empire Strikes Back, while Matt Hickey from Forbes went to the extent of contacting George Lucas about the question, but received no answer.In response to the speculations, Best tweeted, \"I will say this, it feels really good when the hidden meaning behind the work is seen.

He tells them of an operational shield generator that he found, leading him to deduce that a Geonosian is still alive. Saw convinces them that they need to find the Geonosian, as it could tell them why the Empire virtually exterminated its species. They discover the Geonosian, whom Ezra names \"Klik-Klak\". Saw aggressively interrogates Klik-Klak and forces him to lead them to the source of an energy reading, handcuffing him as well. They reach his home, which Gerrera ransacks, suspecting him to be hiding something. The Rebels learn that Klik-Klak has been protecting an egg of his race, and take him to the Ghost for questioning. Saw resorts to torturing him with electric shock and even threatening to destroy the egg. However, upon finding more evidence of the genocide of the Geonosians by the Empire, Saw has a change of heart and lets Klik-Klak back to his lair, giving him a chance to rebuild the Geonosian population. 0.0012284490209327216\n",

Gerrera declines on the basis of Kreegyr's separatist politic. In the episode One Way Out, Rael learns from his Imperial contact, Lonni Jung, that the Imperial Security Bureau (ISB) is aware of Kreegyr's plans.

      "One of the primary themes of The Mandalorian is parenting and fatherhood, expressed through the father-son relationship dynamic between the Mandalorian and the Child. Ryan Britt of Fatherly wrote: \"For years the Star Wars franchise avoided depicting a parent-child dynamic. With Mando and The Child, that's finally changing.\" Several reviewers have compared the dynamic between the Child and the Mandalorian to Lone Wolf and Cub, a manga about a samurai warrior and his young son. The Child makes the Mandalorian a softer and more relatable character; he changes in a positive way because of raising the Child, becoming less selfish and self-absorbed. Several examples of the Mandalorian parenting the Child appear throughout the series, such as when he stops the Child from pressing random buttons in the cockpit of the Mandalorian's spaceship, ultimately by holding him in his lap. In another example, the Mandalorian sets up a car seat for the Child in the cockpit of the ship, so he can be seated safely and comfortably during their travels.The relationship between the Mandalorian and the Child is an example of unexpected fatherhood. The Mandalorian feels a connection and parental bond with the Child because of his own childhood, when he was orphaned by the deaths of his parents and was adopted by the Mandalorians as a \"foundling\". Nevertheless, fatherhood was not a role the Mandalorian was initially seeking, and he makes repeated early attempts to avoid this responsibility. He first does so in \"Chapter 3: The Sin\", when he leaves the Child with the Client, and then again in \"Chapter 4\" Sanctuary\", when he plans to leave the Child with Omera, a protective mother on the planet Sorgan who is willing to take the Child into her own family. The Mandalorian does not fully commit to the role of fatherhood until the first-season finale, \"Chapter 8: Redemption\", when the Child himself is also adopted into the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\" and the Mandalorian is formally declared to be his father figure.Anthony Breznican of Vanity Fair noted that none of the day-to-day difficulties of parenthood are portrayed in the series: \"There is no shrill squawking from Baby Yoda, no tantrum, no spit-up, no uncontrollable shrieking that burrows into a parent's psyche like a dentist's drill shredding a soft, pink nerve.\" Likewise, Vulture writer Kathryn VanArendonk said the show ignores or does not address many parenting details that make fatherhood difficult, such as what the Child eats, when he goes him to sleep, and whether he wears diapers. She wrote: \"The Mandalorian is uninterested in diapers, and so Mando gets to be a very particular image of fatherhood: the guy who doesn't have to sweat the small stuff.\" VanAnderonk described this as a wish fulfillment fantasy for parents or prospective parents: \"a vision of parenting stripped so thoroughly of all detail and specificity that all that's left are archetypes: the parent, the child\".Gina Carano feels the Child brings a warmth to a series that acts as a counterbalance to the Mandalorian himself, who otherwise acts aloof and unemotional. Carano believes in this way, the Child \"raises the emotional level and the stakes\" of the series. Breznican echoed this sentiment: \"There is an emotional transference happening here. The audience cares more about the unnamed, faceless Mandalorian because he cares so much about Baby Yoda.\" Despite his raw natural ability with the Force, the Child is untrained and still depends heavily on the assistance of the Mandalorian and other allies for protection. An interaction the Mandalorian has in \"Chapter 5: The Gunslinger\" with Peli Motto, a mechanic who briefly watches over the Child, is one of the most overt discussions about the challenges of parenthood. When the Mandalorian accidentally wakes the Child, who had been sleeping in Peli's arms, she chides him: \"Do you have any idea how long it took me to get it to sleep?\" She also condemns the Mandalorian for leaving the Child alone on the ship, saying: \"You have an awful lot to learn about raising a young one\".ScreenCrush writer Matt Singer argued the Mandalorian's parenting errors make the show more appealing and relatable because making mistakes is a large part of being a parent. Some moments in the series have led fans to reevaluate the Child and question whether he may demonstrate evil tendencies, such as when he uses the Force to choke Cara Dune while she is engaged in a friendly arm wrestling match with the Mandalorian in \"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\". Caitlin Gallagher of Bustle suggested rather than building toward the Child becoming evil, the show could be suggesting the Mandalorian needs to find a way to raise the Child in a less violent environment. It will largely fall to the Mandalorian to provide this guidance, as when the Mandalorian stops him from strangling Cara. 0.0011239841858889457\n",

Although the two are initially at odds, as the Mandalorian demands Vanth to give him the armor, they become reluctant allies when Mos Pelgo is attacked by a krayt dragon, which the Mandalorian agrees to help slay in exchange for Vanth's armor.

      "The character was partially inspired by Clint Eastwood, particularly his Man with No Name character in Spaghetti Western films directed by Sergio Leone. Pascal said any time he had a question or doubt about how his character would physically act or move, he would ask himself: \"What would Clint do?\" The Mandalorian was also inspired by samurai characters in the films of Japanese director Akira Kurosawa. Pascal said of the Kurosawa influence: \"It's aesthetically and very, very much narratively built in that kind of iconic lone gunslinger/sword-wielder.\" Favreau suggested Pascal watch Kurosawa's samurai films and Leone's westerns starring Eastwood as preparation for the role, and Pascal watched such specific films as Yojimbo (1961) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966). Han Solo, of the main characters from the Star Wars franchise, also served as an influence for Pascal's performance.The Mandalorian character was first publicly described in a brief three-sentence synopsis about the series that Favreau posted on his Instagram account on October 3, 2018. It described the character as \"a lone gunfighter in the outer reaches of the galaxy far from the authority of the New Republic\". Favreau later said: \"This is a character you've never met before in a period of time you've never seen.\" The first image of the Mandalorian was released on October 4, 2018. The gender and other details about the character were not immediately revealed. Based upon the released photo, Germain Lussier of Gizmodo described the character as \"an imposing, confident presence, with a great mix of Mandalorian armor and personal, functional additions\". The Mandalorian executive producer Dave Filoni called the Mandalorian a \"survivor\" just trying to make a living and \"find his way on a day-to-day basis\", which he felt was unique from other protagonists in the Star Wars franchise, particular the Jedi. Since the real name and face of the Mandalorian were not initially revealed, many speculated his true identity would be a character already known in the Star Wars franchise. Some speculated it would be Boba Fett himself, but Lucasfilm denied this, and the show's creators differentiated between the two characters in interviews.Footage of the Mandalorian was first publicly unveiled at the Star Wars Celebration convention in Chicago on April 14, 2019, which included scenes of him receiving bounty hunting assignments from Greef Karga and the Client in the premiere episode. The character was also featured prominently in the first official trailer for The Mandalorian, released on August 23, 2019, and in the second Mandalorian trailer, released on October 28, 2019.

Before they can learn more, they are forced to destroy the base and escape from the pursuing Imperial forces.

With Ahsoka reluctant to train Grogu because of his strong attachment to the Mandalorian, the latter helps Ahsoka defeat Elsbeth and liberate Calidan in the hopes of changing her mind.

      "Many of the scenes for The Mandalorian were filmed on a sound stage in Southern California on a \"Volume\", a large warehouse-like motion-capture stage with green screens and tracking cameras spread throughout the space. Using a combination of physical set pieces and images projected onto the screens, the Volume allows the actors to be filmed and placed into a digital environment. The Mandalorian's scenes on an icy planet at the beginning of \"Chapter 1: The Mandalorian\" were filmed in this setting, as were scenes on the planet Arvala-7 in the first two episodes of the first season, and the scenes on Ran Malk's space station in \"Chapter 6: The Prisoner\", to name a few. Pedro Pascal said of the filming process: \"This is taking it to the next level for me in terms of the world-building and the attention to detail on the costumes, the creatures, the robots, the entire world. It feels sometimes like not too much is left to the imagination in terms of what's there.\"The use of this filming technology, rather than a traditional green screen backdrop, allowed the Mandalorian filmmakers to avoid challenges that would be associated with the reflection of the green screen against the Mandalorian's reflective helmet and armor costume. Imagery was projected onto 360-degree LED walls, which not only provided photorealistic sets for the actors to perform against, but also allowed the reflections that appeared on the Mandalorian's costume to reflect the setting around him as if it were a real-world location. Cinematographer Greig Fraser said: \"When you're dealing with a reflective subject like the Mandalorian, the world outside the camera frame is often more important than the world you see in the camera's field of view. What's behind the camera is reflected in the actor's helmet and costume, and that's crucial to selling the illusion that he's in that environment.\" A long, narrow band of white near the top of the LED wall served an additional purpose of providing a backlight look on the Mandalorian's helmet. The filmmakers would also occasionally request additional lighting be projected onto the wall of the set, so that it would reflect onto the Mandalorian's costume and provide additional definition to the character's shape. Fraser said filming the chrome helmet of the Mandalorian in particular is a challenge because its sharp edges can \"quickly look video-like\" if the lens on the camera is too sharp. This problem was resolved via the use of full-frame Ultra Vista anamorphic lenses by Panavision that were modified to provide a softer sharpness. These lenses were too soft for human faces, so different filming techniques were used on unmasked characters than those used for the Mandalorian.Upon first accepting the role, Pascal thought the large amount of enthusiasm among Star Wars fans would prove intimidating, but he later said it ultimately supported his performance: \"As a cast member, to have that kind of support to life you into it, is such an essential component—more so than anything I've done before.\" Pascal felt Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni shielded him and the rest of the cast and crew from the pressures that might otherwise have been associated with filming the first live-action Star Wars series and one of the first shows for the Disney+ streaming service, instead creating an environment where they could focus on the work. Favreau felt the Mandalorian character worked well and was very engaging despite not being seen behind the costume, noting that many beloved Star Wars characters lack anthropomorphism, citing R2-D2 as an example. Gina Carano said Pascal tries to convey his own doubts and vulnerabilities as an actor through his performances, which she felt ultimately makes the Mandalorian more relatable. She said: \"You want to know who is this guy underneath here. You can feel his personality, you want to know more about him. He's so sexy.\" Favreau paid close attention to minor details about the Mandalorian character, including one instance in which he felt the Mandalorian's boots did not have the appropriate level of frost on them for scenes on an icy planet, so he had them modified to include more frost.Pascal said because the character speaks so seldom, he had to recall his acting school lessons to convey the character's emotions simply with \"posture and gesture\". Pascal called this a very detail-oriented process, noting that small gestures had a large emotive impact, requiring vigilance about each subtle movement. Pascal said his past stage acting experience also helped with this, including his performances in works of commedia dell'arte, in which he wore masks and delivered performances in animated and exaggerated ways to convey emotions. He said portraying the Mandalorian was similar, but \"in the opposite tone of economical movements\". Deborah Chow said physicality was extremely important in working with the character, and that they needed to develop a physical language for the Mandalorian: \"All his movement is intentional. There's no fidgeting or relaxing, so that any time, even if he makes a small move or turns his head, it becomes meaningful. We couldn't do it with his face or with his eyes.\" Much of that physicality was dictated by the costume itself and the weight distribution necessary to move in it. Brendan Wayne said the type of walk they wanted for the Mandalorian came naturally to him, so much so that when Pascal struggled with it, the filmmakers would suggest he seek Wayne's input. Pascal tried to match his vocal performance to the body language, and his recordings were often tweaked in post-production to achieve this.Pascal was working on multiple projects at the same time as The Mandalorian, so he did not appear in every episode. He was not present for the filming of \"Chapter 4: Sanctuary\" at all because he was in rehearsals for a production of King Lear on Broadway. Instead, Wayne performed the majority of the character's scenes in that episode. Director Bryce Dallas Howard said of Wayne: \"He absolutely just brought everything to that character, and we were able to find the moments and figure them out together.\" Wayne said that episode's scenes with Julia Jones, the actress who played Omera, were so emotional that he cried underneath the helmet. Wayne also wore the costume for portions of \"Chapter 3: The Sin\", including the scene when he entered the Razor Crest and was jumped by Greef Karga from behind. Wayne idolizes Weathers so he enjoyed filming the scenes with him. Wayne recited the Mandalorian's lines while shooting the scenes, to be replaced with Pascal's vocal performances later, and Weathers said Wayne's delivery was very similar to that of his grandfather John Wayne. Wayne also said the animatronic puppet used to create the Child character was so realistic that it felt like working with an actual child actor.Pascal and Emily Swallow knew each other prior to filming The Mandalorian. They were familiar with each other through the New York theatre scene, and both appeared on the show The Mentalist at the same time. When she first learned about The Mandalorian, Swallow believed it would be challenging to present a protagonist who viewers never actually saw, but she believed Pascal could do it because \"I sort of knew just based on who Pedro is that his goodness would come across\". 0.0011239841858889457\n",

Finding themselves onboard the second Death Star in her grandfather Emperor Palpatine's throne room (during the events of Return of the Jedi), Rey witnesses his apprentice, Darth Vader, give him a mug as a gift, of which Palpatine is dismissive. Uneasy, Rey reactivates the portal and leave through it, unknowingly witnessed by Palpatine, who sends Vader through the portal to investigate. On Kordoku, Rey is shocked as Vader enters through the portal before she can close it, igniting his lightsaber before using the Force to snatch the key out of Rey's hands upon noticing her. While the Sith Lord tries to figure out what the device is, Rey charges at him with her lightsaber, and the pair battle with both lightsabers and Force-thrown rocks. He asks if she is a Jedi and Rey confirms this is so. The two fight over the key, causing it to open another portal, sucking them inside and leaving BB-8 behind. 0.0011239841858889457\n",

      "On the release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, fans noticed a lack of tie-in toys featuring Rey, despite her being presented as the film's main protagonist. Hasbro released a version of Monopoly based on The Force Awakens that excluded the Rey character. After receiving criticism, Hasbro stated that they did not include Rey to avoid revealing spoilers, and would be including Rey in future toy releases. Paul Southern, the head of Lucasfilm Licensing, said that they wanted to protect the secrets that \"the Force awakens in Rey\" and that her character carries a lightsaber. He said that demand for Rey products was underestimated. Abrams said, \"I will say that it seems preposterous and wrong that the main character of the movie is not well represented in what is clearly a huge piece of the Star Wars world in terms of merchandising.\" Regarding Rey's relative absence in Star Wars merchandising, CBBC presenter and voice actor Christopher Johnson stated: \"It still baffles me to this day that some toy manufacturers don't think that girls want to play with 'superhero' toys and that boys aren't interested in female characters.\" 0.0011239841858889457\n",

      "As Luke repairs BB-8, Rey regrets her recklessness in setting Vader on the loose with the ability to travel through time, before being confronted by Yoda's Force spirit. Lamenting her failure to teach Finn and stop Vader, Yoda reassures her that she can learn from failure to be a better student or better teacher. He shows her a Force vision of her friends celebrating Life Day aboard the Millennium Falcon and Finn using what she thought him to prevent a tree from being toppled, before showing her visions of various Jedi masters with their students including Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin, Yoda, and Luke, leading Rey to realize that these masters and students shared a friendship. After Yoda leaves, Rey meditates and uses the Force to light up the other crystals in the cave surrounding the doorway, creating a new portal which she enters with BB-8 and Luke. Finding herself on the second Death Star again, Rey is shocked to see Kylo Ren with Palpatine thirty years into the future (after the events of The Last Jedi). Palpatine learns of his own betrayal and apparent death at Vader's hands (although unaware of his secret survival), and recruits Ren to the past to take Vader's place as his primary apprentice. 0.0011239841858889457\n",

      "The Mandalorian character was created by Jon Favreau, the creator and showrunner of The Mandalorian. Favreau is a long-time Star Wars fan, and the Mandalorians are one of his favorite groups of characters from the franchise; he previously voiced one of them in the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars. The title character of Favreau's series is considered the first live-action depiction of a Mandalorian, the concept of which was never used in the films, although the Mandalorian culture has been expanded upon in other Star Wars works like The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels. Boba Fett has been associated with the Mandalorians in Star Wars books and other media, but that detail was never featured in the films. Favreau said in creating the Mandalorian character, he attempted to match the look and aesthetics of the original Star Wars trilogy, particularly the first film, Star Wars (1977). Several Lucasfilm artists created concept art for the character during development of the series, including Christan Alzmann, Doug Chiang, Ryan Church, Nick Gindraux, Jama Jurabaev, and John Park. 0.001123984185888943\n",

      "The character and Ridley's portrayal have received critical acclaim. Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal proclaims that Rey is \"a woman warrior with the stylish ferocity of a kung-fu star,\" praising \"the verve [Ridley] must have been born with plus the skill she must have acquired as a young actress coming up in England,\" and stating, \"It's hard to imagine what the movie—and the sequels to come—might have been if they'd cast the wrong person, but here Daisy Ridley is in all her unassuming glory, and all's right with the galaxy.\" Adam Howard of MSNBC states that \"one of the most pleasant surprises of the film has been the strength of its lead female character,\" adding that some have likened Rey to a \"new feminist icon\".In a personal essay, Nicole Sperling of Entertainment Weekly writes about her daughters feeling empowered after viewing the film, stating, \"They never commented on how pretty Rey is. They never had to flinch because Rey was a sexual object to some man in power. They just felt strong. Equal.\" Megan Garber of The Atlantic writes that Rey \"proves herself to be, in extremely short order, extremely adept as a fighter\". Emily Rome of HitFix describes Rey as \"more 'strong female character' than strongly written\", saying \"the speed with which Rey mastered Jedi mind tricks and lightsaber fighting with zero training is the stuff of fan fiction. Rey is geek feminist wish-fulfillment\". Rome says Rey is \"everything we wanted in a Star Wars female character,\" praising her for being a character that is \"independent, skilled, scrappy, tough, and doesn't need saving.\"Twitter users have debated whether Rey is a Mary Sue (an unrealistically perfect, idealized character) on the basis of Rey's seemingly natural skills as a mechanic, a fighter, a pilot, and a user of \"The Force\", which draw admiration from the film's other main characters. Screenwriter Max Landis posted a series of tweets in 2015 derisively referring to The Force Awakens as \"a fanfic movie with a Mary Sue as the main character\". Tasha Robinson of The Verge writes that Rey \"keeps falling into standard-issue damsel-in-distress situations, then capably rescuing herself [...] She's a fantasy wish-fulfillment character with outsized skills, an inhuman reaction time, and a clever answer to every question — but so are the other major Star Wars heroes.\" Robinson suggests viewers enjoy Rey's \"Mary Sue flawlessness\", saying, \"We wouldn't be worrying about Rey's excessive coolness if she were Ray, standard-issue white male hero\".Other outlets, including Ridley herself, have argued that the term Mary Sue carries an inherent gender bias, and that the male characters from the original trilogy did not face comparable criticism. Media critic Caroline Framke argues that Rey's abilities are not necessarily any more impressive than those of the character of Luke Skywalker, and that fans' instinctive criticism of characters like Rey reflects a double standard in that seemingly perfect male heroes are rarely so criticized. J. J. Abrams stated that \"the people who are getting freaked out are the people who are accustomed to [male] privilege, and this is not oppression, this is about fairness.\" He elaborated, \"You can probably look at the first [Star Wars] movie that George [Lucas] did and say that Leia was too outspoken, or she was too tough. Anyone who wants to find a problem with anything can find the problem. The internet seems to be made for that.\" Adrienne Tyler of Screen Rant argued that Rey's abilities are explained in The Rise of Skywalker as resulting from the pair forming a dyad in the Force, sharing the same fighting capabilities.Rey's unique hairstyle attracted attention before and after The Force Awakens was released, being compared to Leia's hairdo from the original film, with debate over whether it would become as popular. Rey has also been compared to the titular character from the Hayao Miyazaki anime film Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984).Richard Roeper described Ridley's portrayal of Rey as \"a breakout performance\", continuing by calling the character \"tough and resourceful and smart and brave\". Ridley was nominated for a 2016 Saturn Award for Best Actress for her portrayal. The first Reel Women in Technology Award for a fictional character was awarded to the character Rey.Some fans criticized Rey's trilogy-wide character arc as insufficient.  Fan fiction author Ricca said that tension that was built in the first two films never gets resolved in the last film.  She wanted a moment at the end of The Rise of Skywalker in which Rey reacts to and reflects on everything that has happened to her.Some critics and fans have noted a visual resemblance between Rey's character design to that of Bastila Shan from the video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, and that her character arc shares thematic similarities with that of Bastila's. 0.001123984185888943\n",
