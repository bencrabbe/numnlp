The first edition of the DDC was published in 1876, the eighteenth edition in 1971, and future editions will continue to appear as needed. In spite of the DDC's long and healthy life, however, its full story has never been told. There have been biographies of Dewey that briefly describe his system, but this is the first attempt to provide a detailed history of the work that more than any other has spurred the growth of librarianship in this country and abroad.\n",

      "text: This report is an analysis of 6300 acts of use in 104 technical libraries in the United Kingdom. Library use is only one aspect of the wider pattern of information use. Information transfer in libraries is restricted to the use of documents. It takes no account of documents used outside the library, still less of information transferred orally from person to person. The library acts as a channel in only a proportion of the situations in which information is transferred. Taking technical information transfer as a whole, there is no doubt that this proportion is not the major one. There are users of technical information - particularly in technology rather than science - who visit libraries rarely if at all, relying on desk collections of handbooks, current periodicals and personal contact with their colleagues and with people in other organizations. Even regular library users also receive information in other ways.\n",

      "text: The relationships between the organization and control of writings and the organization and control of knowledge and information will inevitably enter our story, for writings contain, along with much else, a great deal of mankind's stock of knowledge and information. Bibliographical control is a form of power, and if knowledge itself is a form of power, as the familiar slogan claims, bibliographical control is in a certain sense power over power, power to obtain the knowledge recorded in written form. As writings are not simply, and not in any simple way, storehouses of knowledge, we cannot satisfactorily discuss bibliographical control as simply control over the knowledge and information contained in writings.\n",

Long-established attitudes and methods were questioned, but although changes were made, the basic difficulty remained - a lack of objective information about the best ways of providing a library service in a university. The report of the UGC Committee on Libraries (the Parry Repot [267]), which, in general, endorsed these changes, also stressed the need for research into all aspects of academic library provision.\n",

      "text: Although the use of games in professional education has become widespread only during the last decade, the method has been used in a number of fields for many hundreds of years. Its origins have been traced to simple war games, used in military training when the \"real thing\" was either unavailable or too dangerous. In more recent times, these games have become more and more sophisticated, and many now use large electronic computers to handle the complex calculations involved. Since 1956, when the first well-developed management game was introduced, the technique has spread rapidly into a wide variety of disciplines and today it is used at all levels of education, from primary school classes to courses for experienced professional men and women. One of the main causes of this \"game explosion\" has been the rapid development of sophisticated management techniques, such as simulation and mathematical modelling, which have been made possible by rapid advances in computer technology.\n",

      "text: Graduate library school study of abstracting should be more than a how-to-do-it course. It should include general material on the characteristcs and types of abstracts, the historical development of abstracting publications, the abstract-publishing industry (especially in the United States), and the need for standards in the preparation and evaluation of the product. These topics we call concepts. The text includes a methods section containing instructions for writing various types of abstracts, and for editing and preparing abstracting publications. These detailed instructions are supplemented by examples and exercises in the appendix. There is a brief discussion of indexing of abstract publications. Research on automation has been treated extensively in this work, for we believe that the topic deserves greater emphasis than it has received in the past. Computer use is becoming increasingly important in all aspects of librarianship. Much research effort has been expended on the preparation and evaluation of computer-prepared abstracts and extracts. Students, librarians, and abstractors will benefit from knowing about this research and understanding how computer programs were researched to analyze text, select key sentences, and prepare extracts and abstracts. The benefits of this research are discussed. Abstracting is a key segment of the information industry. Opportunities are available for both full-time professionals and part-time or volunteer workers. Many librarians find such activities pleasant and rewarding, for they know they are contributing to the more effective use of stored information. One chapter is devoted to career opportunities for abstractors.\n",

      "text: As important for staff members' individual development as was the apprenticeship in administration, perhaps the most significant attitude one acquired while working for Guy was engendered by his insistence that librarians must be interested in and knowledgeable about the content of the materials with which they dealt. His love of literature, his respect for scholarship, his admiration for good writing and reading were manifested in many ways, but most notably in his admonition that, though we were primarily a research library, we must constantly keep in mind our obligation to collect contemporary poetry, fiction and belles-letters. It was primarily up to the library staff, he felt, to be responsible for these as well as for \"general\" books which crossed disciplinary lines or fell between the disciplines, those books which a faculty mostly concerned with research materials is apt to overlook. And in building this portion of the collection, \"there is no substitute for a thorough acquaintance with books through a reading of critical reviews and the books themselves.\" This counsel is from The President, the Professor, and the College Library, but the importance of its thrust--the need to keep up with the world of books and publishing--was continually impressed upon us.\n",

      "text: This study assumed that an additional use study held less promise than an analytical consideration of concepts. The basic approach was a survey comparing traditional and current professional ideas on direct access. Principal data-gathering instruments were documentary analysis and opinion questionnaire. Findings of the documentary analysis included the following: Research from 1890 to 1970 on the direct shelf approach and browsing left the problems largely unresolved and evidently resistant to established methods of use and user research. The need for an exhaustive study of concepts was confirmed. Open shelf libraries--organized through shelf classification and relative location--were meant to arouse the intellectual, social, and political interest of the average citizen and affect his democratic self-realization. Definitions of \"browsing\" varied greatly: self-indulgence by the untutored in objectionable works; beneficial self-education for the general reader; valuable guidance for the scholar in his research.\n",

      "text: The purpose of this study was to develop, evaluate, and recommend a national plan for improving access to periodical resources. About 48 percent of all academic interlibrary loans are for periodical materials, with the bulk of the loans being satisfied in the form of photocopies. A major consideration in the long-range improvement of the interlibrary loan system is the possible augmentation with a national system for acquiring, storing, and satisfying loan requests for periodical materials. This study focused on the physical access to the periodical literature. Based on the needs of the library community, design features were developed, and included the following: Service should be made available to all users without any restriction other than access through a library. Initially, the service should be confined primarily to rapid, dependable delivery of photocopies of journal articles. The collection of a center should be comprehensive in subject coverage excluding only medicine. All worthwhile journals should be collected irrespective of language.\n",

Until the mid-1960's, there were only a few substantial studies of information needs and uses. Since about 1963, however, a significant literature has grown rapidly. There is evidence now of a productive entente between the fields. When information scientists see reliable, valid, and nontrivial data on users' behavior, they begin to use behavioral criteria in evaluating information system performance. When behavioral scientists glimpse the full complexity of dissemination, documentation, storage, and retrieval processes, they offer fewer naive solutions to \"the information problem.\" This mutual education and accommodation will undoubtedly continue.

Survey items dealt with education, sex, age, salary, job mobility and preference for continuing education programs.. Some 60 percent of the respondents were professionals; 40 percent were nonprofessionals.. Seven hundred and twenty-eight chief librarians were identified in the population: 57 percent were professional librarians while the remainder were without a graduate library degree.. Approximately 1/5 of all survey respondents were men.. The age distribution for the work force tended to be bimodal, reflecting the career patterns of women and the later entry of men into librarianship.. The annual salary for male professionals was calculated at $12,732; for female professionals at $10,044; for male nonprofessionals at $7,878; and for female nonprofessionals at $6,313.. Male professionals were found to have the highest rates of job and geographic mobility.. Conversely, female nonprofessionals were lowest in mobility.. In expressing a preference for continuing education programs in library science, professionals tended to request courses dealing with the organization of libraries, health sciences institutions and their relationships, while nonprofessionals inclined towards courses in technical processing..\n",

      "  Communication technology has entered a period of revolutionary change. The last decade has brought new inventions of enormous potential. It will probably be two decades before we fully grasp the shattering effect they will have on society. These inventions include: The communication satellite. Suddenly this has provided telephone and television links to the underdeveloped world. Much larger satellites will be built and will have an enormous impact on education and communications both in the United States and throughout the world. The satellite antennae in some underdeveloped countries stand next to fields ploughed by oxen. The helical waveguide. A pipe, now operating, that can carry 250,000 simultaneous telephone calls or equivalent information over long distances. The laser. This means of transmission, still in the research laboratory, has the potential of carrying many millions of simultaneous telephone calls or their equivalent. Large-scale integration (LSI). A form of ultraminiaturized computer circuitry that probably marks the beginning of mass production of computers and computerlike logic circuitry. It offers the potential of extremely reliable, extremely small, and, in some of its forms, extremely fast computers. If large-enough quantities can be built, this circuitry can become very low in cost. On-line real-time computers. Computers capable of responding to many distant terminals on telecommunication lines at a speed geared to human thinking. They have the potential of bringing the power and information of innumerable computers into every office and eventually every home. Picturephone. A public dial-up telephone system in which subscribers see as well as hear each other. Large TV screens. TV screens that can occupy a whole wall if necessary. Cable TV. Provides a cable into homes with a potential signal-carrying capacity more than one thousand times that of the telephone cable. It could be used for signals other than television. Voice answerback. Computers can now assembly human-voice words and speak them over the telephone. This fact, coupled with the Touchtone telephone set, makes every such telephone a potential computer terminal. Millimeter-wave radio. Radio at frequencies in the band above the microwave band can relay a quantity of information greater than all the other radio bands combined. Chains of closely spaced antennas will distribute these millimeter-wave signals. Pulse code modulation. All signals, including telephone, Picturephone, music, facsimile, and television can be converted into digital bit stream and transmitted, along with computer data, over the same digital links. Major advantages accrue from this. Computerized switching. Computerized telephone exchanges are coming into operation, and computer-like logic can be employed for switching and \"concentrating\" all types of signals. Data banks. Electronic storage for huge quantities of information that can be manipulated and indexed by computers and that can be accessed in a fraction of a second.\n",

Because none of the available computer search programs met the criteria of the center, and because of the need to handle a variety of data bases, new general purpose computer programs were written, and a tape format was developed so that a wide variety of data bases can be searched by the same computer program. The center was designed to provide current awareness and retrospective search services from both document-type and data-type computerized data files. The desire to develop transferable programs for use at many installations prompted the adoption of the machine-independent compiler language PL/1 and the use of IBM 360 series computers.

For the purpose of this introductory handbook 'reader instruction' is taken to mean instruction given to readers to help them make the best use of a library, particularly an academic library of some size and complexity.\n",

      "  To take advantage of computerized data bases to improve their services to scientists without incurring prohibitive in-house expense, the librarians at the Boulder Laboratories have campaigned to increase awareness and utilization via personal interviews, seminars, surveys, and critiques. Data bases most studied were DDC, NASA, SIE, ASCA, and the University of Georgia. The conclusions: 1) The scientist needs continuous personal assistance by a librarian or information specialist in order to make effective use of data bases. 2) As local retailer, the librarian has an accordingly important role to play now and in the future, a role at present generally ignored.\n",
